2 Why we need a substantial sample 

Uncertainty about the population value of the thing we want to know more about is influenced by two factors. The first one is probably intuitive, namely the number of cases we have in our sample. If we ask just five people how they feel about the new feature we recently introduced, and a majority responded negatively, it is very well possible that we happen to have asked a bunch of sourpusses who would have rejected every possible new feature to the website. But if you ask a few hundred people and the majority did not respond positively, we can no longer assume that the cheerfulness of the users that happened to be in the sample interfered with the awesomeness of the new feature. It is pretty safe to say the new feature is not perceived as awesome.   

As we increase the sample size, the sample is guaranteed by the rules of probability to be a more representative set of cases of the population. If in the real world 30% of the people is gloomy and 70% is cheerful, it could be quite possible that we end up with a negative majority in our sample of size five (for those keen on math the probability is 0.163). However, if our sample has five hundred people on it there is no way this would happen (this is actually probability is too small to compute on a 64 bit machine). No matter the mathematics, just keep the following rule in mind:  

As the number of people in our sample increases, the sample is guaranteed to look more and more like the general population. When the sample gets large enough, we can rule out other factors disturb our analysis.
