A proportion is formed each time two outcomes are possible. Does the user choose to click or not to click, does the broker rate us favourable or unfavourable on a certain topic, are visitors returning to the site within three days or not? We collect a certain number of cases (the total number of trials N) and we count the number of successes (the desired option out of the two). The proportion is then constructed by dividing the sum of the successes by N. 

Proportions are closely related to percentages, which are proportions multiplied one-hundred. People are more used to percentages and they are a little easier to digest because proportions are always numbers smaller than one. However, when doing data analysis it is easier to work with proportions because we can interpret them as probabilities. The proportion in the sample is the estimate of the probability of success in a single trial for a new case. As with all estimates we do we have to take uncertainty due to error variance into account. The more data are used to obtain the probability the more certain we are about the true value of the probability of success.
