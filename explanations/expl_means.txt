Means are the central point of a continuous distribution, the measured variable is a number. Such as the rating a users give us or the revenue a realtor brings in. The mean of the sample is also the value that is the estimate of the true value of the mean in the population. As with all all statistical tests, the more observations we have in the sample, the more likely it is the true value is around this estimate. Also, when most of the observations are close to the sample mean, we are more certain that the estimate is close to the true value of the mean. Therefore you need to report three things to determine the distribution of this statistic; the sample mean, the sample size, and the sample standard deviation. 

When comparing means in this way, we assume that the distribution the data is comping from is approximately normal. This test will not be useful for distribution that are highly skewed. In a skewed distribution a number of values are extreme on one side. Typically skewness occurs when the variable cannot be negative and there are a few cases with really high values. This oftentimes happens for monetary variables, such as salary or revenue. You can detect skewness by plotting your variable in a histogram. If you data is indeed skewed, or you are not sure how to assess if it is skewed, consult a data scientist to help it the test.
